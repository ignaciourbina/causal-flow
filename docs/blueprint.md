# **App Name**: CausalFlow

## Core Features:

- Variable Input: Add and name variables for the path diagram.
- Period Definition: Define the number of time periods for variable measurement.
- Tabular Display: Display a tabular layout showing variables measured at each time period.
- Path Definition: Visually connect variables by clicking one node and then another. Links between different variables may target the same period or the immediate next period. Self-loops can span multiple periods. When skipping over other variables in a period, elbow connectors are placed in separate lanes to avoid overlap.
